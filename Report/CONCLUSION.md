# Problem

PREDICT CREDIT CARD CUSTOMER ATTRITION APPLICATION OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION

# Aim

Determine the probability of attrition of an account holder within the next six months. 


# Requirements  
Credit Card Attrition datasets, Machine Learning model, Python, Sklearn

# Description  
	The data is a sample of credit card customer accounts as of Mar-2013 and the attrition has been defined as customers closing their credit card account within the next 6 months (Apr-2013 - Oct-2013). The sample has a mix of snapshot data as of Mar-2013 and historical data covering past 12 months prior to Mar-2013, including their demographic profile and transaction information.
    The dataset contains 10127 rows and 27 columns.
    Dataset contains some missing values in the columns which are Customer_Age and Credit_Limit.
    Logistic Regression classifier is used to build the model. Accuracy of about 91% is achieved on test data.
